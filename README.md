## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

While building this webpage, I had to spend sometime trying to create a navbar that did not feel very out of place.
I tried using some css on it. But it felt weird so I refrained from using css in the final version.

I also had some difficulties with the reduce function as I had never used it before so I had to spend sometime learning about it before I could complete the challenge.
